# 🚢 Project 2: Titanic Dataset Analysis

This project explores the Titanic dataset to uncover survival patterns based on passenger demographics and travel class. It focuses on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visual storytelling using Python.

---

## 📊 Objectives

- Understand survival distribution across gender and passenger class
- Clean and preprocess data by handling missing values
- Visualize data trends using Seaborn and Matplotlib
- Discover key correlations among numerical features
